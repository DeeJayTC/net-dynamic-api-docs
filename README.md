# ðŸ˜Ž Welcome!

The API Generator automatically generates a fully working CRUD Microservice from just your Model (C# Classes) or a JSON Definition. Everything from routes, database handling, migrations, openapi spec, OData etc is working magically out of the box! You just write your model and get a fully working CRUD api with filtering, sorting, selectable fields and everything else OData and classic REST offers.\
\
By using the API Gen, this little snipet is already a full API

```csharp
 [Api("/people", ApiMethodsToGenerate.All )]
 public class Person : Trackable, 
    IObjectBase<Guid>,
    IBeforeUpdate<Person>, // Before Update Hook
    IBeforeDelete<Person>, // BeforeDelete Hook
 {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
 }
```
